Planar data classification using a neural network with one hidden layer(Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer)

Used units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh or ReLu for hidden layer and sigmoid function for the output layer.


accuracy result:
number of hidden units = 4

accuracy using tanh(z) as the activation function of hidden layer = 90%

accuracy using ReLu(z) as the activation function of hidden layer = 70.75%
